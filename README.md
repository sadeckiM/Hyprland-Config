In this setup I used a lot of AI stuff and took inspiration from git repository by [Firstp1ck](https://github.com/Firstp1ck/Hyprland-Simple-Setup)

Especially wallpapers are the one of the most significant things that I use in my OS from this repository. Other things are woki and waybar styles.

My aim was to make simple floating window environment for terminal use in beautiful Arch theme. I hope to introduce more things to make my configuration perfect for me (especially keyboard shortcuts).

### Programs I use
- Command prompt: Starship
- Display managment: mng-displays
- Image viewer: swayimg
- Document viewer: sioyek
- Wallpaper slideshow: swww
- Network: network-manager
- Videos: VLC
- Password manager: KeePassXC
- AI: Google Gemini Pro
- Internet: Firefox (but I'm searching something more secure)
- GUI file manager: Dolphin (it's not good working with Hyprland, QT6 is necessary)
- Calculator: Qalculate-gtk
and many more that aren't listed here.
